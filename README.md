# pangotype
A containerised version of pangolin and aln2type, providing an amalgamated output from the the two tools. Designed principally with the RIE SARS-CoV-2 sequencing effort in mind.

# Background
The pangotype tools runs within a docker container that has pangolin and aln2type installed. Will be up to date at the time of pulling, but will need to be continually updated to stay current. This is achieved with bash scripts.
